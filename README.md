Blackbaud-CRM-Custom-Event-Manager-With-BizOps--Java-
=====================================================

## What You Will Build ##

This customization demonstrates how to address custom event manager through Business Operations Services (BizOps), which is a wrapper API for AppFxWebService targeted to all developers. BizOps are strongly typed SOAP web services, and you can use them to access Infinity features by adding a reference to the ASMX and beginning to code.

## Prerequisites ##

This customization requires you to intsall the Infinity SDK for your hosted Infinity application, and the Blackbaud.AppFx.WebAPI.dll that the customization uses to ease communication to the AppFxWebService.asmx has a dependency on .NET Framework 4.0.

The customization builds upon a previous customizatoin to create a custom user interface to retrieve a list of events from the Infinity database, and [Step by Step Instructions](https://www.blackbaud.com/files/support/guides/infinitydevguide/infsdk-developer-help.htm#../Subsystems/inwebapi-developer-help/Content/InfinityWebAPI/coExampleConsumingTheBlackbaudAppFxWebServiceUsingANETWinFormsClient.htm) are available for consuming the Blackbaud AppFx Web Service this way.
